If you are a fan of Adele, you probably know her hit song "Hello" from her album "25". But did you know that you can listen to this song in a high-quality audio format that preserves every detail of her voice and music? This format is called FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), and it is a type of compressed audio file that does not lose any data or quality when compared to the original source. In this article, we will explain what FLAC is, why it is better than other formats, and where you can find Adele's "Hello" single in FLAC 24 bit 192kHz.

## What is FLAC and why is it better than other formats?
  
FLAC is a type of audio file that compresses the original sound data without discarding any information. This means that the file size is smaller than an uncompressed file, but the quality is exactly the same. Unlike other formats such as MP3 or AAC, which use "lossy" compression and remove some data to reduce the file size, FLAC preserves the full dynamic range and frequency spectrum of the sound. This results in a more accurate and realistic reproduction of the original recording.
  
FLAC files can also have different bit depths and sampling rates, which affect the quality and resolution of the sound. Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent each sample of sound, while sampling rate refers to the number of times per second that the sound is measured. The higher the bit depth and sampling rate, the more detailed and clear the sound will be. For example, a CD-quality audio file has a bit depth of 16 bits and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, which means that each second of sound is represented by 44,100 samples of 16 bits each. A FLAC file can have a bit depth of up to 32 bits and a sampling rate of up to 655 kHz, which means that each second of sound can be represented by 655,000 samples of 32 bits each.
  
Adele's "Hello" single was released in FLAC 24 bit 192 kHz, which means that each second of sound is represented by 192,000 samples of 24 bits each. This is a very high-quality audio format that captures every nuance and detail of Adele's voice and music. Compared to other formats such as MP3 or AAC, which typically have a bit depth of 16 bits and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz or lower, FLAC 24 bit 192 kHz offers a much richer and fuller sound experience.
  
## Where can you find Adele's "Hello" single in FLAC 24 bit 192 kHz?
  
If you want to listen to Adele's "Hello" single in FLAC 24 bit 192 kHz, you will need two things: a source file and a compatible player. A source file is the original audio file that contains the song in FLAC format. A compatible player is a device or software that can play FLAC files without converting them to another format.
