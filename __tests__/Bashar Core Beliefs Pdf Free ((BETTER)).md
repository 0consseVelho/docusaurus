## How to Use Bashar's PDF to Change Your Core Beliefs
 
Now that you have downloaded Bashar's PDF, you might be wondering how to use it to change your core beliefs. Here are some steps you can follow to make the most of this powerful tool.
 
1. Read the PDF carefully and familiarize yourself with the Enneagrammatic Circuit and the nine types of beliefs. Bashar explains the meaning and function of each type, as well as the basic needs and fears that drive them.
2. Identify your core beliefs by using the PDF as a reference. You can do this by asking yourself questions such as "What do I believe about myself?", "What do I believe about others?", "What do I believe about life?", and "What do I believe about reality?". You can also use your emotions as clues, since they are indicators of your beliefs. For example, if you feel angry, you might have a belief that someone is violating your rights or boundaries.
3. Write down your core beliefs on a piece of paper or a journal. Be honest and specific, and don't judge yourself for having them. Remember, your beliefs are not who you are, they are just programs that you have adopted from your past experiences.
4. Choose one core belief that you want to change at a time. You can start with the one that causes you the most distress or discomfort, or the one that prevents you from achieving your goals or desires.
5. Create a positive affirmation that contradicts your core belief. An affirmation is a statement that expresses what you want to believe instead of what you currently believe. For example, if your core belief is "I am not good enough", your affirmation could be "I am worthy and valuable". You can use the PDF as a source of inspiration, since it provides some examples of affirmations for each type of belief.
6. Repeat your affirmation daily, preferably in the morning and at night, or whenever you catch yourself thinking or feeling your core belief. You can say it out loud, in your mind, or write it down. The more you repeat it, the more you will reprogram your subconscious mind with the new belief.
7. Act as if your affirmation is true. This means behaving in ways that are consistent with your new belief, and avoiding actions that reinforce your old belief. For example, if your new belief is "I am worthy and valuable", you can act as if by expressing your needs and opinions, setting healthy boundaries, accepting compliments, and pursuing your passions.
8. Observe the changes in your reality. As you change your core beliefs, you will notice that your reality will change accordingly. You will attract more people, situations, and opportunities that match your new vibration. You will also feel more positive emotions such as joy, gratitude, love, and peace.

Changing your core beliefs with Bashar's PDF is a simple and effective way to transform your life. However, it requires patience, persistence, and practice. Don't expect instant results or give up easily. Remember that changing your beliefs is a process that takes time and effort. But it is worth it, because you will create a reality that reflects who you really are.
