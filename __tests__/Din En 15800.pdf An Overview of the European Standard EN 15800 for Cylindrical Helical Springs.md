# What is Din En 15800.pdf and why is it important for spring manufacturers?
 
Din En 15800.pdf is a European standard that applies to cylindrical helical compression springs made of round spring wire. It specifies the quality requirements for cold coiled compression springs, such as the permissible deviations from nominal dimensions, the permissible defects, the surface quality, the mechanical properties and the testing methods.
 
Cold coiled compression springs are widely used in various applications, such as automotive, aerospace, medical, industrial and consumer products. They are designed to store energy and release it when compressed. The quality of these springs affects their performance, reliability and durability.

Therefore, it is important for spring manufacturers to follow the Din En 15800.pdf standard to ensure that their products meet the expectations of their customers and comply with the relevant regulations. By following this standard, spring manufacturers can also improve their production efficiency, reduce their costs and enhance their reputation.
 
The Din En 15800.pdf standard is available for purchase from various online sources, such as [ITEH Standards](https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/standards/cen/ccd4840e-89d8-45ae-bb0d-f8c650b2fa64/en-15800-2008), [SAI Global](https://infostore.saiglobal.com/en-us/Standards/DIN-EN-15800-E-2009-393022_SAIG_DIN_DIN_892001/) and [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/321251122/00-Din-27-Din-en-15800-Springs). The standard was published in December 2008 and supersedes the previous DIN 2095 standard.
  
## Types of Compression Springs
 
Compression springs can be classified into different types based on their shape, end configuration, coil direction and pitch. The most common types are:

- **Cylindrical compression springs:** These springs have a constant diameter throughout their length and are the simplest and most widely used type of compression springs. They can be made with open or closed ends, ground or not ground ends, and right-hand or left-hand coiling.
- **Conical compression springs:** These springs have a varying diameter from one end to the other and are used when there is not enough space for a cylindrical spring. They can also be nested inside each other to create variable spring rates. They can have open or closed ends, ground or not ground ends, and right-hand or left-hand coiling.
- **Barrel compression springs:** These springs have a convex or concave shape and are used to reduce the solid height and buckling tendency of cylindrical springs. They can have open or closed ends, ground or not ground ends, and right-hand or left-hand coiling.
- **Hourglass compression springs:** These springs have a narrow waist in the middle and are used to provide a variable spring rate and reduce resonance. They can have open or closed ends, ground or not ground ends, and right-hand or left-hand coiling.

## Applications and Advantages of Compression Springs
 
Compression springs have many applications in various industries and sectors, such as:

- **Automotive:** Compression springs are used in suspension systems, brakes, clutches, valves, fuel injectors, seat belts, airbags and more.
- **Aerospace:** Compression springs are used in landing gears, engines, control systems, actuators, switches and more.
- **Medical:** Compression springs are used in surgical instruments, implants, orthodontic devices, drug delivery systems and more.
- **Industrial:** Compression springs are used in machinery, tools, pumps, valves, compressors, generators and more.
- **Consumer:** Compression springs are used in toys, pens, watches, locks, appliances, furniture and more.

Some of the advantages of compression springs are:

- **Versatility:** Compression springs can be designed and manufactured in various shapes, sizes, materials and configurations to suit different applications and requirements.
- **Elasticity:** Compression springs can store and release a large amount of energy when compressed and return to their original shape when unloaded.
- **Durability:** Compression springs can withstand repeated cycles of loading and unloading without losing their strength or performance.
- **Economy:** Compression springs are relatively easy and cheap to produce and maintain compared to other types of springs.
