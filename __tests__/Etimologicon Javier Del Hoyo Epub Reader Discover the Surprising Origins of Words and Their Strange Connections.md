Etimologicon is a book by Javier Del Hoyo, a Spanish philologist and writer, that explores the etymology of hundreds of words from different languages and cultures. The book is divided into 26 chapters, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet, and covers topics such as history, mythology, science, art, religion, literature, and more.

The book is written in a witty and entertaining style, with anecdotes, curiosities, and surprises that reveal the hidden connections between words and their meanings. For example, did you know that the word "alcohol" comes from Arabic and means "the essence" or "the spirit"? Or that the word "robot" was coined by a Czech writer in 1920 and means "forced labor"? Or that the word "vampire" has its roots in Serbian and means "bloodsucker"?
 
Etimologicon is a fascinating and enjoyable read for anyone who loves words and their stories. It is also available as an epub reader, which allows you to access the book on your electronic devices and enjoy its rich illustrations and interactive features. You can find the epub reader version of Etimologicon on SoundCloud[^1^] or on other online platforms.
  
One of the main sources of inspiration for Del Hoyo's book is the Etymologisches WÃ¶rterbuch der deutschen Sprache (Etymological Dictionary of the German Language) by Friedrich Kluge, a German linguist who published his work in 1883. Del Hoyo acknowledges Kluge's influence and dedicates a chapter to him and his contributions to the study of etymology.
 
Another interesting aspect of Etimologicon is that it includes words from many languages besides Spanish and English, such as Latin, Greek, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and more. Del Hoyo shows how these languages have influenced each other and enriched the vocabulary of humanity. He also explains how some words have changed their meaning or connotation over time, sometimes in surprising ways.
 
For example, he tells us that the word "silly" originally meant "happy" or "blessed" in Old English, but later acquired a negative sense of "foolish" or "stupid". He also reveals that the word "nice" used to mean "ignorant" or "simple" in Latin and French, but later evolved to mean "pleasant" or "agreeable". He also traces the origin of the word "clue", which comes from "clew", an old word for a ball of yarn that was used by Theseus to find his way out of the labyrinth in Greek mythology.
  
Etimologicon is not only a book about words, but also a book about culture, history, and human creativity. Del Hoyo shows how words reflect the values, beliefs, and experiences of different peoples and times. He also demonstrates how words can inspire new ideas, inventions, and discoveries. For example, he explains how the word "atom" comes from Greek and means "indivisible", but later led to the development of atomic theory and nuclear physics.
 
Another example is how the word "museum" comes from Greek and means "a place dedicated to the Muses", the goddesses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology. Del Hoyo tells us how the first museums were temples where people could learn and worship the Muses, but later became places where people could admire and study various objects of art and knowledge.
