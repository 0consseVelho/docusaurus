Logic design is the branch of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of digital circuits and systems. Logic design is essential for the development of very large scale integration (VLSI) devices, such as microprocessors, memory chips, and communication systems. Logic design involves both theoretical and practical aspects, such as Boolean algebra, minimization techniques, sequential machines, testing methods, and fault tolerance.
 
One of the challenges of teaching and learning logic design is to find a textbook that covers both the traditional topics and the new advances in the field, while being rigorous, clear, and accessible. Logic Design Theory By Nn Biswas is a textbook that satisfies these requirements admirably. Nn Biswas is a well-known researcher in logic design, an author of successful textbooks, and a respected teacher.

- Computer science: Logic design theory is the foundation of computer hardware and software. Logic gates are used to build processors, memory units, input/output devices, and other components of a computer system. Logic design theory also helps to design algorithms, data structures, programming languages, compilers, operating systems, databases, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and more.
- Electrical and electronics engineering: Logic design theory is essential for the development and analysis of electrical and electronic circuits and systems. Logic gates are used to implement digital signal processing, communication, control, automation, robotics, biomedical engineering, power engineering, and more.
- Mathematics: Logic design theory is closely related to discrete mathematics, which studies finite structures such as sets, graphs, combinatorics, algebra, number theory, and more. Logic design theory also helps to formalize mathematical reasoning and proofs.
- Philosophy: Logic design theory is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature and principles of valid reasoning and argumentation. Logic design theory also helps to explore philosophical concepts such as truth, validity, soundness, consistency, completeness, decidability, and more.
- Linguistics: Logic design theory is useful for the study of natural and artificial languages. Logic design theory helps to analyze the syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and rhetoric of languages. Logic design theory also helps to create formal languages and grammars for various purposes.

These are just some examples of the applications of logic design theory. Logic design theory is a rich and fascinating subject that has many connections and implications for other disciplines.
