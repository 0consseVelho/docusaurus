Microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of individual agents and markets. It deals with topics such as demand, supply, price, elasticity, production, cost, competition, monopoly, factor pricing, income distribution, efficiency and welfare. Microeconomics is a vast and complex subject that requires rigorous analysis and mathematical tools.
 
One of the most renowned authors in the field of microeconomics is Hl Ahuja, a professor of economics at Delhi University. He has written several books on microeconomics that are widely used by students and teachers across India and abroad. In this article, we will review three of his books: Modern Microeconomics[^1^], Principles of Microeconomics[^2^] and Advanced Economic Theory[^3^].
