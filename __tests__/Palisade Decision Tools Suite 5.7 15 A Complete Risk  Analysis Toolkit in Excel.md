One of the most popular tools in Palisade Decision Tools Suite 5.7 15 is @RISK, which performs risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation is a technique that shows you many possible outcomes in your spreadsheet and how likely they are to occur. This helps you judge which risks to take and which ones to avoid. You can also compare different scenarios and strategies to find the best one for your situation.
 
Another powerful tool in Palisade Decision Tools Suite 5.7 15 is PrecisionTree, which performs decision analysis using decision trees and influence diagrams. Decision trees let you visually map out complex decisions in a sequential, organized manner. This helps you identify all possible alternatives and choose the best option. Influence diagrams let you represent uncertain factors and their relationships in a graphical way. This helps you understand how different variables affect your decision.
