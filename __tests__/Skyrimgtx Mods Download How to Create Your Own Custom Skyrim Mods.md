Skyrimgtx is a modder who creates high-quality followers, presets, armors, weapons, and other enhancements for Skyrim. However, some of his mods are not available on Nexus Mods or other popular modding sites, and some of them are sold for real money on his Patreon page. This article will show you how to download and install Skyrimgtx mods for Skyrim Special Edition for free.
 
## Step 1: Find the Mod You Want
 
There are several sources where you can find Skyrimgtx mods, such as YouTube videos, Reddit posts, or Google searches. However, not all of them are reliable or updated, so you need to be careful and check the comments or reviews before downloading anything. Here are some examples of Skyrimgtx mods that you can download for free:

## Step 2: Download the Mod Files
 
Once you have found the mod you want, you need to download the mod files from the source. Some sources may require you to create an account or request access before downloading. Some sources may also have multiple files or parts that you need to download separately. Make sure you download all the files that are required for the mod to work.
 
## Step 3: Install the Mod Files
 
After downloading the mod files, you need to install them into your Skyrim Special Edition game folder. There are different ways to do this, depending on the type of mod file and your preference. Here are some common methods:

- Manual installation: This method involves copying and pasting the mod files into your Skyrim Special Edition game folder. You need to follow the instructions provided by the mod author or source on where to place the files. For example, if the mod file is a .esp or .esm file, you need to place it in the Data folder. If the mod file is a .bsa or .ba2 file, you need to place it in the Data folder and edit your Skyrim.ini file to register it. If the mod file is a .nif or .dds file, you need to place it in the appropriate subfolder under Data\meshes or Data\textures.
- Mod manager installation: This method involves using a mod manager program such as Nexus Mod Manager (NMM), Mod Organizer 2 (MO2), or Vortex to install the mod files automatically. You need to follow the instructions provided by the mod manager on how to add and activate the mod files. For example, if you are using NMM, you need to click on the green plus icon and select "Add mod from file" to browse and select the mod file. Then you need to double-click on the mod name in the list to activate it.
- Archive installation: This method involves using an archive program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the mod files from a compressed archive such
