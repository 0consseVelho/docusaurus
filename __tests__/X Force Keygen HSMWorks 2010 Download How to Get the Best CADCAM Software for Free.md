- Use the integrated SolidWorks environment to design your parts and assemblies. You can access Autodesk HSMWorks 2010 from the SolidWorks menu or toolbar and work on your CAM projects without leaving SolidWorks.
- Use the HSMWorks browser to manage your CAM data and settings. You can create and edit operations, tools, templates, stock models, coordinate systems, and more from the HSMWorks browser. You can also drag and drop operations and tools to reorder them or copy them to other setups.
- Use the simulation feature to verify your toolpaths before machining. You can simulate your toolpaths in 3D or 2D mode, with or without stock material, and with different display options. You can also measure distances, angles, and radii in the simulation window.
- Use the post processor feature to generate NC code for your CNC machine. You can choose from a variety of post processors that are compatible with different CNC machines and controllers. You can also edit or create your own post processors using the post processor editor.
- Use the documentation feature to generate reports and drawings for your CAM projects. You can create setup sheets, tool lists, operation lists, and more from the documentation menu. You can also export your reports and drawings to PDF, HTML, or DXF formats.
